            Assignment 2 was more complicated than assignment 1. This assignment aimed to create an event landing page for a fictional event. This assignment helped me gain a comprehensive understanding of building a complete website since that is exactly what I did. I created a one pager with navigation links which are linked to different sections within the event page as well as the AI declaration and the assignment reflection.
            <br><br>
            I faced several challenges while completing this assignment as I have not built a full-scale working page using html and css before. Firstly, I had confusion on using semantic tags and whether or not I should be using article or sections. Based on my research about both article and section from MDN, I came to the conclusion to use section tags and divs within if I needed. Secondly I found it challenging to format content structurally using css and the biggest dilemma was with if I should use grid or flex box. Since part of the requirement for the assignment was to make it responsive across all platforms I felt flex box would be the best option.
            <br><br>
            The relationship between html and file structures is essential because anything visible on the webpage is basically through html. And then we format the content/files using css.
            <br><br>
            The biggest challenge I faced with this assignment is formatting each section one by one and I feel like I reused a lot of css rules over and over again, which was finally confirmed by ChatGPT when I checked for redundant code and it suggested that I could have used general classes to avoid using the same css rule over and over again. It was enlightening to read and I did not dare to implement it because my code was finally working so well and everything was displaying exactly how I had envisioned it. But I did learn how to code more efficiently in the future.
